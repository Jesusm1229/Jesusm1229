  **My current points**


- Object Oriented Design (OOD) with the planning of interacting systems under the four principles of Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism.
- Handling of data structures. I implement the use of efficient data organization to get the most out of the software.
- I design under SOLID principles. I integrate the highest standards in the design and construction of robust software.
  Design of relational and non-relational databases, from the planning of a system, I adjust the information storage capabilities to the needs and best response         required.
